/**
 * @file contracts.ts — contracts shared by ALL decisions of the engine.
 *
 * The same engine decides in several directions (seeker→candidates, broadcast
 * need→candidates, provider→open needs, seeker→incoming offers). Each
 * deployment maps its data to these contracts; the engine only sees the
 * contracts. This is what makes the model domain-agnostic: anything
 * expressible as a situated query against situated candidates — service
 * marketplaces, emergency dispatch, field-crew allocation, distributed
 * logistics — can consume it by changing data sources and priors only.
 * Pure (types + helpers).
